        <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
        <img src="../img/nutrition1.jpg" alt="nutrition1"/>
        <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>

        <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p>

        <p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity level and calories.</p>

        <p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>

        <p>Did you know the average American consumes 3 Ibs of sugar each week?</p>

        <h3>What to Eat</h3>
        <img src="../img/nutrition2.jpg" alt="nutrition2"/>
        <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
            <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
            <li>Fruit</li>
            <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.</p>
        <p>When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.</p>
